# Local Search
The local search metaheuristic is an *iterative improvement* heuristic, since every move is only applied if the result is better than the current solution. The algorithm stops as soon as it finds a local minimum.

1. GenerateInitialSolution
2. while(termination not met)
    1. Pick a new solution
    2. If the new solution is better than the old one, replace our old one
