# Example : Fibonacci
## General Analysis & Formula
To illustrate the steps above, we will apply them to one of the easiest problems out there. The Fibonacci problem. In the Fibonacci problem, our goal is to find the **n'th** Fibonacci number, where the solution is given by the sum of the 2 previous numbers. 

Let's write this out as a formula

$$Fib(n) = Fib(n - 2) + Fib(n - 1)$$
