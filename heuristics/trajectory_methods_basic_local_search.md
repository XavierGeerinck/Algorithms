# Local Search
The local search metaheuristic is an *iterative improvement* heuristic, since every move is only applied if the result is better than the current solution. The algorithm stops as soon as it finds a local minimum.

## Algorithm
1. GenerateInitialSolution
2. while(improvement possible)
    1. Improve the solution until no possible improvement is found

## Example
The traveling salesman problem: A salesman has to go to N doors to sell his goods. What is the shortest path that he can take?
