# Red-Black Trees

## General

* Allows us to do all operations \(Access, Search, Insertion, Deletion\) in O\(log\(n\)\) time.
* Is based on a BST \(=Binary Search Tree\) with a color bit
* Preferred over a AVL tree if we need to do more insertions and deletions

### Properties

* Every node is black or red
* The leafs of the tree \(nil's\) are **black**
* Red nodes can not have a red parent- or child
* Every path from a node to a "descendent" \(nil node\) has the same amount of black nodes, we call this the **"black-height"**

We try to keep these properties by using _rotation_ or _recoloring_

### Rotation

* We can rotate left or right, this text is for right rotation
* Take I as the new root
* Make the original right child \(Î²\) the left child of the new right child \(P = old root\)
* Left rotation is symmetrical

### Bottom-Up Insertion

Every time we insert a node, we will set its color to red and the root node to black, this because the root always has to be black. Now follow these steps:

**Legend:** N = new node, S = sibling of N, P = parent, U = uncle of parent, G = grandparent

1. Insert as you would in a BST tree, but make the new node = red \(so if &gt; go right, if &lt; go left\)
2. If P is NOT BLACK or N is not the root
    1. U is red
        * Make U and P black
        * Make G red
        * Repeat from G
    2. U is black
        * Left Left Case \(P is left child of G and N is left child of P\)
        * Right Rotate G and Switch colors P and G
        * Left Right Case \(P is left child of G and N is right child of P\)
        * Left Rotate P --&gt; Back to the Left Left case
    3. N is root, set color to black
