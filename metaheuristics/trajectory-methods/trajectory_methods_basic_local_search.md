# Local Search

The local search metaheuristic is an _iterative improvement_ heuristic, since every move is only applied if the result is better than the current solution. The algorithm stops as soon as it finds a local minimum.

## Algorithm

1. GenerateInitialSolution
2. while\(improvement possible\)
   1. Improve the solution until no possible improvement is found

## Example

The traveling salesman problem: A salesman has to go to N doors to sell his goods. What is the shortest path that he can take?
