In this book you will find important and efficient algorithms used in Computer Science today. This list was created based on the courses that I got during my studies at the University Of Ghent (Belgium), containing 4 major aspects:

* Data Structures
* Graph Algorithms
* String Algorithms
* Metaheuristics 

These major aspects cover a wide are of algorithms, going from easy tree algorithms to creating inverted file indexes which are used in search engines today.

Please note that this book is created to give a quick overview of the algorithms and how they work. If you want a more in depth explanation of these algorithms, I encourage you to find more material elsewhere.

In the future, I hope to add other important algorithms such as the Sorting algorithms, Dijkstra, ... however because there are so many topics already, I first hope to be able to finish all of those.

Because this book is this large, errors are possible and can be corrected. For errors to be corrected, feel free to open a pull request or an issue at: https://github.com/thebillkidy/Algorithms
