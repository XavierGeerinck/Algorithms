## Operations

* **Search:** To find a certain key we look at the data item and keep following the next pointer until our key has been found
* **Insertion:** To insert, we add an element at the front of the list O\(1\)
* **Deletion:** Find the element, then delete it, reconfiguring the links

## Double Linked List

* In a double linked list, we can move backwards and forwards through the items
