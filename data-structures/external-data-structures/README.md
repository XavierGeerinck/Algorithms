# External Data Structures

What happens when we got algorithms that require a size that is bigger then our internal RAM? Well this is where External Datastructures provide a solution. These datastructures utilize the external medium such as hard disks to write data to. The biggest problem that arises here is that writing to a disk is a lot slower than writing to the RAM memory.
