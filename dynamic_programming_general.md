# Dynamic Programming
## General
Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems, that require solutions of the same sub-problems. It does this by breaking down the initial problem in sub-problem and then tries to find a solution for these sub-problems. Once it found this, it will store these solutions for re-use later.

We can think of it as a "carefully chosen brute force" which will try all the possibilities, but avoid having an exponential amount by limiting them.

**Core ideas**
* Guessing (Try all the different choices and take the best one)
* Recursion (Express the solution of a problem in terms of subproblems)
* Memoization (Once we found an answer, store in a lookup table = write on memo pad, and re-use later)

> Dynamic programming will basically express a problem as a Dynamic Acyclic graph (DAG) and find the shortest path in it

We can find the runtime for a dynamic programming problem by using the following formula:

$$runtime = \#subproblems * time/subproblem (treat~a~recursive~call~as~Î˜(1))$$

## Steps to find a solution
We can break down every dynamic programming problem in a few steps which will help us to find a problem:
1. Define the subproblems and count them (#subproblems)
2. Guess (part of the solution), it is possible that there are no guesses. (#choices)
    * *Example #1:* In a knapsack problem we can choose between picking the item, or leaving it
    * *Example #2:* In Fibonacci there are no choices so = 1
3. Relate subproblem solutions (gets the time/subproblem)
4. Build an algorithm using one of the two techniques described. (make sure that subproblem is acyclic, so that we can use topological order)
    * Recurse & Memoize (Top-Down method)
    * Build a DP table (Bottom-up method)
5. Solve the original problem

> A quick tip on learning Dynamic Programming, is to think about the problems in a top-down fashion instead of bottom-up. We will however still program the problems in a bottom-up fashion, since it makes it easier to find the time and space complexity and results in a shorter source code.

## Small Example
To illustrate the steps written above, let's practice this with a small problem. Let's say we have **N** Coins with a separate value and a total sum **S**. Find the least coins required that have a combined value of our sum S.
